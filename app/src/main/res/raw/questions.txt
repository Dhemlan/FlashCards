Describe the 3 asymptotic notation forms
Big theta - bounds growth rate above and below. Big O - bounds growth rate above. Big Omega - bounds growth rate below.
1
Define stability with regard to sorting algorithms
Equal sorted elements retain the same relative position as the input
2
What makes a sorting algorithm adaptive?
Changes in the time complexity based on the order of input elements (e.g. bubble sort is faster with an already sorted input)
12
How does selection sort work? Is it stable? Is it adaptive?
Scans all elements to find the minimum, then swaps that element into the appropriate position. Repeat. It is unstable and non-adaptive.
2
What are the average, best, worst and space complexities of selection sort?
Time complexities are all O(n^2). Space = O(1)
